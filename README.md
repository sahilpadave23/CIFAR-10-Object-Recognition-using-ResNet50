# CIFAR-10-Object-Recognition-using-ResNet50
CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. 
The ResNet50 model is a convolutional neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image classification tasks.
We have performed transfered learning, Transfer learning (TL) is a technique in machine learning (ML) in which knowledge learned from a task is re-used in order to boost performance on a related task
After training completes, the script will display the training and validation accuracy over each epoch
